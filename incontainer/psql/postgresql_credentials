docker exec -it n8n-ai-postgres-dashboard psql -U dashboard_user -d dashboard_db
psql -h localhost -p 5434 -U dashboard_user -d dashboard_db


Run the SQL Migration:
Copy and paste the entire SQL migration script into the psql terminal to create the necessary tables. If you are using a graphical interface like PgAdmin, you can execute the SQL directly there.

Verify Tables:
After running the migration script, verify the tables have been created by running:

\dt  -- Lists all tables in the current database


You should see llm_chat_history, employee_dashboard, webhook_history, and llm_agents listed among the tables.

Using pgAdmin to Run the Migration:

Access pgAdmin: Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5050 (or the IP address of the server running Docker).

Login to pgAdmin: Use the default credentials (spencermreiser@gmail.com / trustno2).

Connect to PostgreSQL Instance: Add a new server connection:

Name: Dashboard DB

Host: n8n-ai-postgres-dashboard

Port: 5432

Username: dashboard_user

Password: dashboard_password

Execute the Migration: Once connected, open the Query Tool in pgAdmin, paste the SQL script, and click "Execute".
